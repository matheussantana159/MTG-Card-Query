# MTG-Card-Query
Using Python to grab card data CSV in order to put into an AI deck generator. 
  - The idea started with me wanting to use AI to analyse the current cards I own (stored within Helvault/Moxfield) and create a deck with high syneregy based on Mana, Color Idenitiy, Format, Price, and Abilities.
